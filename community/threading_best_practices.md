# Operation Code Threading Best Practices

In the interest of keeping conversation flowing and easy to follow for new members, Operation Code has developed these guidelines for the use of the ‘thread’ feature in Slack. 
​
The following is the only rule moderators will make an effort to enforce:
- Threading conversations in #general will be enforced. Members cannot leave this channel, and this is our main channel for organization announcements. 
​
The following are community agreed-upon best practices for the use of the ‘thread’ feature. 
- Please thread off-topic convos (e.g. talking about Game of Thrones in #java).
- Consider threading tangentially related topics that may not be interesting to a wide audience, or have to do with a specific use case.
- Please thread one-off comments and asides. 
- If the original poster requests that a conversation is in a thread, please honor this request.
