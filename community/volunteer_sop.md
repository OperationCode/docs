4 May 2020

## VOLUNTEER OPERATIONS

### INTENT

Define volunteer progression and engagement process at Operation Code, to include recruitment, onboarding, engagement, growth, and offboarding..

### HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

The document is broken into multiple sections, each of which is intended to capture a simple, list of tasks and sub-tasks (e.g. "send DM" or “schedule video call”) that can then be included in various routinely-used checklists and automations, improving the experience for both those already volunteering and those joining the team.

### ENGAGEMENT LEVELS

Volunteers at Operation Code all have busy professional and personal lives. It is critical that we account for the degree in which a volunteer is able to engage, their unique skill setskillset, their availability, and guide them towards the most appropriate role.
