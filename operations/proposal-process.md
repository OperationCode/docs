# Operation Code Board

Operation Code is on a mission to help the military learn software development, enter the tech industry, and code the future.
As an open-source organization, we will open up board discussions for input from our community.

### Process

Everyone is welcome to propose, discuss, and review ideas to improve Operation Code.
To submit a new proposal or discuss an issue, [file an issue](https://github.com/OperationCode/board/issues/new) on Github
to begin the conversation. Once we've reached a majority vote, you can submit a formal proposal that will be reviewed
by the board and voted upon.

### Formal Proposal

A formal proposal can be constructed using the [template](../proposal-template.md). The proposal should answer the following questions:

* What is your evaluation (Pros/Cons) of the proposal?
* How does it impact our community of veterans, military spouses, transitioning servicemembers, and civilian allies?
* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Operation Code?
* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Operation Code?
