# Outreach Team Documents

These documents serve as primary collection for all things related to the Outreach team within Operation Code.

The intent is for the documents to be working documents that are added, removed, or updated by all team members as needed. 

Any comments, questions, or concerns can be brought up in the team Slack channel, or you can email alexb@operationcode.org.
